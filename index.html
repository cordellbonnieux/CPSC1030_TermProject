                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Cordell Bonnieux, I am a Web Developer residing in Vancouver BC.
                    I am currently a student at Langara College, taking the Associates of Computer Science program.
                    I have been making websites since 2002, and professionally since 2014. I have also worked in the past
                    as a graphic designer, for both web and print. My plans after I graduate are to transfer to university
                    and complete a bachelor of computer science degree.
